# SOS
The SOS applications are basically advanced emergency apps that can rescue you and/or your loved ones if you and/or they find themselves in a life-threatening emergency situation and need immediate assistance. When you need some personal assistance, you can actually turn on your phone and can call or message someone for help. But in a life-threatening emergency like attack, sexual assault, robbery, harassment, accident, fire, birth assistance, we don’t have time to open our phone, instead, we need some accessibility methods by which we can reach out for help without actually operating the phone. In this article, we would be building such an application for android.

Developed a women's safety mobile application via Java with real-time GPS tracking, Google Maps integration, and shake-to-alert emergency signaling sending notifications to up to 5 emergency contacts within 2 seconds.
Optimized the development workflow through Gradle and Maven for dependency management, reducing build times by 30% and improving CI/CD pipeline efficiency.
